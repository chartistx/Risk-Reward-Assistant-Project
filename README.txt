This project is an extention to Metatrader 4 platform.
It is a tool that lets user draw risk/reward figures that show calculated risk, profit and risk to reward ratio.
It can be used to send market and limit orders by selecting Limit or Market order button in indicator panel,
drawing risk/reward figure and after that clicking accept button in indicator panel.

Code needs to be updated to commply with best practices for coding
    - currently there are many style issues, mostly with naming variables and lack of comments.
